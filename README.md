To build, run `./build`

To add a section, create a file like the one below in `./sections`, and add its name to `./order.txt` in the appropriate place:

```
# Section name here

## Slide title

Slide contents

## Another slide title

...
```

*Note:* To make lists incremental, put them in block quotes:

```
> - foo
> - bar
```

instead of

```
- foo
- bar
```
